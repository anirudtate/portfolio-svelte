## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is used for formatting text. It allows you to create formatted documents using plain text, which can be easily converted into HTML or other formats.

## Headings

Headings in Markdown are denoted by hash symbols (#) followed by a space, with the number of hash symbols indicating the level of the heading. For example:

```md
# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3
```

# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

## Emphasis

You can add emphasis to text in Markdown using asterisks (\*) or underscores (\_) around the text. For example:

```md
_Italic Text_
_Italic Text_
**Bold Text**
**Bold Text**
```

_Italic Text_
_Italic Text_
**Bold Text**
**Bold Text**

## Lists

You can create ordered (numbered) and unordered (bulleted) lists in Markdown. For ordered lists, use numbers followed by a period, and for unordered lists, use asterisks, plus signs, or hyphens. For example:

```md
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
```

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

## Links

You can add links in Markdown using square brackets [] to enclose the link text, followed by round brackets () to enclose the URL. For example:

```md
[Google](https://www.google.com)
```

[Google](https://www.google.com)

## Images

You can add images in Markdown using an exclamation mark (!) followed by square brackets [] to enclose the alt text, and round brackets () to enclose the image URL. For example:

```md
![Image Alt Text](https://astro.build/assets/press/astro-logo-light.svg)
```

![Image Alt Text](https://astro.build/assets/press/astro-logo-light.svg)

## Code Blocks

You can create code blocks in Markdown by enclosing the code in triple backticks (```) at the beginning and end of the block. For example:

````md
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
````

```md
print("Hello, World!")
```

---

## Tables

You can create tables in Markdown using pipes (|) to separate columns and hyphens (-) to create the table header. For example:

```md
| Column 1 | Column 2 |
| -------- | -------- |
| Row 1    | Row 1    |
| Row 2    | Row 2    |
```

| Column 1 | Column 2 |
| -------- | -------- |
| Row 1    | Row 1    |
| Row 2    | Row 2    |
